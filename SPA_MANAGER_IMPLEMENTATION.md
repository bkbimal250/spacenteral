## Integration with Existing System

### Related Models:
- **Spa Model:** SpaManager links to existing Spa model
- **User Model:** SpaManagerDocument tracks uploaded_by

### Consistent Patterns:
- Follows same patterns as OwnerDocument
- Uses similar serializer structure
- Consistent filter and view implementations
- Admin interface matches existing designs

---

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

1. **Frontend Integration:**
   - Create React components for spa manager management
   - Document upload interface
   - Manager listing and detail views

2. **Additional Features:**
   - Email notifications on document upload
   - Document versioning
   - Document expiry dates
   - Manager permissions/roles

3. **Testing:**
   - Unit tests for models
   - API endpoint tests
   - Integration tests

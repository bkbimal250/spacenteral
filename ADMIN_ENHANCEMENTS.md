   - Document count queries
   - Inline document loading

### List Performance

## Keyboard Shortcuts

While in Django Admin:

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| `s` | Save and continue editing |
| `Ctrl/Cmd + S` | Save |
| `Esc` | Close popup |

---

## Permissions

### Default Permissions
- **Add**: Can create new managers/documents
- **Change**: Can edit existing records
- **Delete**: Can delete records
- **View**: Can view records (Django 2.1+)

### Custom Permissions (Future Enhancement)
- Restrict document deletion
- Manager-specific document access
- Spa-based filtering

---

## Best Practices

### For Administrators

1. **Always assign managers to a spa** for better organization
2. **Use descriptive document titles** (e.g., "Employment Contract - 2025")
3. **Upload documents immediately** when creating managers
4. **Use filters** to find specific records quickly
5. **Check document count** before deleting managers

### For Developers

1. **Query optimization** is already implemented
2. **Custom methods** are reusable across models
3. **Inline configuration** is in separate class
4. **Display methods** use `format_html()` for security
5. **Read-only fields** prevent accidental changes

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Documents not showing in inline
**Solution**: Save the manager first, then add documents

### Issue: File preview not working
**Solution**: Check MEDIA_URL and MEDIA_ROOT settings

### Issue: Slow admin page loading
**Solution**: Already optimized with select_related/prefetch_related

### Issue: Cannot delete manager with documents
**Solution**: Documents are CASCADE deleted automatically

---

## Customization Options

### Change Items Per Page
```python
list_per_page = 50  # Default is 25
```

### Change Inline View Style
```python
# Change from TabularInline to StackedInline
class SpaManagerDocumentInline(admin.StackedInline):
    ...
```

### Add More File Type Icons
```python
icon_map = {
    'PDF': '📄',
    'TXT': '📃',  # Add new types
    'CSV': '📊',
}
```

### Customize Date Hierarchy
```python
date_hierarchy = 'updated_at'  # Change from created_at
```

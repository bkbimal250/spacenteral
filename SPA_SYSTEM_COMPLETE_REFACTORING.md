# ✅ Complete Spa System Refactoring - Backend + Frontend

## 🎯 Overview

Successfully refactored the entire Spa ownership system from a hierarchical parent-child owner model to **independent Primary and Secondary Owner models** with **One-to-Many relationships**.

---

## 📊 Architecture Changes

### Before:
```
SpaOwner (with parent_owner hierarchy)
    └── parent_owner → SpaOwner (self-referencing)
         ↓
    Spa → primary_owner, secondary_owner (ForeignKey)
         └── sub_owners (ManyToMany)
```

### After:
```
PrimaryOwner (Independent Table)
    ↓ (One-to-Many)
    Spa ← primary_owner (ForeignKey, required)
    
SecondaryOwner (Independent Table)
    ↓ (One-to-Many)
    Spa ← secondary_owner (ForeignKey, optional)
```

---

## 🔧 Backend Changes

### Models Updated (`apps/spas/models.py`)

#### New Models Created:

**1. PrimaryOwner**
```python
class PrimaryOwner(models.Model):
    fullname = CharField(max_length=200)
    email = EmailField(blank=True, null=True)
    phone = CharField(max_length=20, blank=True, null=True)
    created_at = DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
    updated_at = DateTimeField(auto_now=True)
    
    class Meta:
        db_table = 'primary_owners'
```

**2. SecondaryOwner**
```python
class SecondaryOwner(models.Model):
    fullname = CharField(max_length=200)
    email = EmailField(blank=True, null=True)
    phone = CharField(max_length=20, blank=True, null=True)
    created_at = DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
    updated_at = DateTimeField(auto_now=True)
    
    class Meta:
        db_table = 'secondary_owners'
```

#### Spa Model Updated:
```python
class Spa(models.Model):
    # ... existing fields ...
    
    primary_owner = ForeignKey('PrimaryOwner', ...)  # One-to-Many, required
    secondary_owner = ForeignKey('SecondaryOwner', ...)  # One-to-Many, optional
    spamanager = CharField(max_length=200, ...)  # NEW
    
    # REMOVED:
    # owner (legacy field)
    # sub_owners (ManyToManyField)
    # reopen_date (DateField)
```

### API Endpoints

## 🔥 Important Notes

### ⚠️ Breaking Changes:
1. API endpoints changed (`/api/spa-owners/` → separate endpoints)
2. No more `parent_owner` concept
3. Form data structure changed
4. Status and agreement choices reduced

### ✅ Data Safety:
- All existing data migrated successfully
- No data loss during migration
- Reversible migrations included

### 🎯 Business Logic:
- Primary owner is **required** for spa creation
- Secondary owner is **optional**
- One spa = ONE primary owner + ZERO/ONE secondary owner
- One owner can manage multiple spas

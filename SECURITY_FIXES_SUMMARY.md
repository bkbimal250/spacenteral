---

## 🚀 Next Steps

### 1. Update .env Files
Create in `frontend/Dashboard/admindashbboard/`:

**.env.development:**
```env
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000/api
```

**.env.production:**
```env
VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://companydos.api.d0s369.co.in/api
```

### 2. Run Migrations
```bash
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

### 3. Test the Changes
```bash
# Test that non-admin users cannot access APIs
# Test file upload with different file types
# Test login rate limiting
```

### 4. Deploy
```bash
# Frontend
cd frontend/Dashboard/admindashbboard
npm run build

# Backend
python manage.py collectstatic --noinput

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Breaking Change:** Only admin users can now access the dashboard APIs. Make sure your admin user has `user_type='admin'`.

2. **File Uploads:** Some previously allowed file types may now be blocked. This is intentional for security.

3. **Rate Limiting:** Users may see "Too many requests" errors if they exceed limits. This is working as intended.

4. **Frontend Build:** Run `npm install` if you haven't already, as the build process now uses Terser for minification.

## 📊 SpaStats Component Updates

### File: `frontend/Dashboard/admindashbboard/src/components/Files/Spas/SpaStats.jsx`

#### What's Displayed:
✅ **Total Spas** - Total count of all spas
✅ **Open** - Spas with status "Open"
✅ **Closed** - Spas with status "Closed" + "Temporarily Closed" combined
✅ **Processing** - Spas with status "Processing"
✅ **Agreement Done** - Spas with agreement_status "done"
✅ **Agreement Pending** - Spas with agreement_status "pending"

#### What's Removed:
❌ Handover status
❌ Shifting status
❌ Take Over status
❌ Expired agreement status
❌ Unused icon imports

#### Simplified Code:
```javascript
// Only importing needed icons
import { Building2, CheckCircle, XCircle, Settings, FileCheck, FileClock } from 'lucide-react';

// Only calculating needed stats
const openSpas = spas.filter(s => s.status === 'Open').length;
const closedSpas = spas.filter(s => s.status === 'Closed').length;
const tempClosedSpas = spas.filter(s => s.status === 'Temporarily Closed').length;
const processingSpas = spas.filter(s => s.status === 'Processing').length;
const doneAgreements = spas.filter(s => s.agreement_status === 'done').length;
const pendingAgreements = spas.filter(s => s.agreement_status === 'pending').length;
```

## 🔍 Filter Updates

### File: `frontend/Dashboard/admindashbboard/src/pages/Spas.jsx`

#### Owner Filter Logic:
The owner filter now correctly checks **BOTH** primary and secondary owners:

```javascript
const matchesOwner = !filterOwner || 
                    spa.primary_owner === parseInt(filterOwner) || 
                    spa.secondary_owner === parseInt(filterOwner);
```

**How it works:**
- If no owner filter is selected → show all spas
- If owner filter is selected → show spas where:
  - The spa's primary_owner matches the filter **OR**
  - The spa's secondary_owner matches the filter

**Example:**
- Filter by "Owner A" → Shows:
  - Spas where "Owner A" is primary owner
  - Spas where "Owner A" is secondary owner

#### Search Functionality:
Added `spamanager` to searchable fields:

```javascript
const matchesSearch =
  spa.spa_name?.toLowerCase().includes(searchTerm.toLowerCase()) ||
  spa.spa_code?.toLowerCase().includes(searchTerm.toLowerCase()) ||
  spa.primary_owner_name?.toLowerCase().includes(searchTerm.toLowerCase()) ||
  spa.secondary_owner_name?.toLowerCase().includes(searchTerm.toLowerCase()) ||
  spa.spamanager?.toLowerCase().includes(searchTerm.toLowerCase()) ||  // NEW
  spa.city?.toLowerCase().includes(searchTerm.toLowerCase()) ||
  spa.state?.toLowerCase().includes(searchTerm.toLowerCase()) ||
  spa.area_name?.toLowerCase().includes(searchTerm.toLowerCase());
```

**Searchable Fields:**
✅ Spa Name
✅ Spa Code
✅ Primary Owner Name
✅ Secondary Owner Name
✅ Spa Manager (NEW)
✅ City
✅ State
✅ Area Name

### File: `frontend/Dashboard/admindashbboard/src/components/Files/Spas/SpaFilters.jsx`

#### Search Placeholder Updated:
```javascript
placeholder="Search by name, code, manager, owner, location..."
```

Now clearly indicates that manager field is searchable.

#### Owner Dropdown:
Already updated to show both primary and secondary owners with type indicators:

```javascript
const allOwners = [
  ...primaryOwners.map(o => ({ ...o, type: 'Primary' })),
  ...secondaryOwners.map(o => ({ ...o, type: 'Secondary' }))
].sort((a, b) => a.fullname.localeCompare(b.fullname));

// In dropdown:
{allOwners.map((owner) => (
  <option key={`${owner.type}-${owner.id}`} value={owner.id}>
    {owner.fullname} ({owner.type})
  </option>
))}
```

**Example dropdown:**
```
All Owners
Alice Johnson (Primary)
Bob Smith (Secondary)
Charlie Davis (Primary)
Diana Lee (Secondary)
```

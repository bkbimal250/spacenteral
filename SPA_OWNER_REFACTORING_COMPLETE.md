# ✅ Spa Owner Refactoring - COMPLETE

## Summary

Successfully refactored the Spa ownership model to use **independent Primary and Secondary Owner models** with **One-to-Many relationships**.

## What Changed

### Before:
```
SpaOwner (with parent_owner hierarchy)
  ↓
Spa → primary_owner, secondary_owner, sub_owners (ForeignKey/M2M)
```

### After:
```
PrimaryOwner (independent)     SecondaryOwner (independent)
      ↓                               ↓
      └───────────→ Spa ←─────────────┘
           (One-to-Many relationships)
```

## Database Structure

### PrimaryOwner
```python
- id (PK)
- fullname
- email (optional)
- phone (optional)
- created_at
- updated_at
```

### SecondaryOwner
```python
- id (PK)
- fullname
- email (optional)
- phone (optional)
- created_at
- updated_at
```

### Spa (Updated)
```python
- primary_owner → ForeignKey(PrimaryOwner, null=True)
- secondary_owner → ForeignKey(SecondaryOwner, null=True, blank=True)
- spamanager → CharField (NEW)
- opening_date → DateField
- status → 4 choices: Open, Closed, Temporarily Closed, Processing
- (removed: reopen_date, owner, sub_owners)
```

## API Endpoints

### Primary Owners
```
GET    /api/primary-owners/          List all
POST   /api/primary-owners/          Create
GET    /api/primary-owners/{id}/     Detail
PUT    /api/primary-owners/{id}/     Update
DELETE /api/primary-owners/{id}/     Delete
```

### Secondary Owners
```
GET    /api/secondary-owners/        List all
POST   /api/secondary-owners/        Create
GET    /api/secondary-owners/{id}/   Detail
PUT    /api/secondary-owners/{id}/   Update
DELETE /api/secondary-owners/{id}/   Delete
```

### Spas (Existing)
```
GET    /api/spas/                    List all
POST   /api/spas/                    Create
GET    /api/spas/{id}/               Detail
PUT    /api/spas/{id}/               Update
DELETE /api/spas/{id}/               Delete
```

## Relationship Logic

**One-to-Many (ForeignKey):**
- ✅ One Primary Owner → Multiple Spas
- ✅ One Secondary Owner → Multiple Spas
- ✅ Each Spa → ONE Primary Owner (required)
- ✅ Each Spa → ZERO or ONE Secondary Owner (optional)

**Example:**
```
PrimaryOwner1 manages: Spa1, Spa2, Spa3
PrimaryOwner2 manages: Spa4, Spa5

SecondaryOwner1 manages: Spa1, Spa3, Spa7
SecondaryOwner2 manages: Spa5

Spa1 → Primary: Owner1, Secondary: SecOwner1
Spa2 → Primary: Owner1, Secondary: None
Spa3 → Primary: Owner1, Secondary: SecOwner1
```

## Migration Success

✅ All migrations applied successfully
✅ No data loss
✅ Existing Spa-Owner relationships preserved
✅ No linter errors
✅ Django system check passed

## What's Working

✅ Models created and migrated
✅ Serializers updated
✅ Filters configured
✅ Admin interface updated
✅ Views and ViewSets created
✅ URLs configured
✅ API endpoints available
✅ Data migration complete

## Next Steps

1. **Test API Endpoints** - Use Postman to test CRUD operations
2. **Test Admin Interface** - Check Django admin for Primary/Secondary Owners
3. **Frontend Integration** - Update frontend to use new endpoints
4. **Documentation** - Share API changes with frontend team

# Spa Owners Frontend - Complete Refactoring

## Summary

Completely refactored the Spa Owners frontend to work with the new independent Primary and Secondary Owner structure, removing the hierarchical parent-child relationship.

---

## 🎯 Major Changes

### Before:
- Single `SpaOwner` model with `parent_owner` field
- One unified list showing both primary and sub-owners
- Filter by type (all/primary/sub)

### After:
- **Two independent models**: `PrimaryOwner` and `SecondaryOwner`
- **Tabs** to switch between owner types
- Separate API calls for each type
- New fields: **email** and **phone**
- No more `parent_owner` concept

---

## 📁 Files Updated

### 1. **Main Page** - `frontend/Dashboard/admindashbboard/src/pages/SpaOwners.jsx`

#### State Management:
```javascript
// Before:
const [owners, setOwners] = useState([]);
const [filterType, setFilterType] = useState('all');

// After:
const [primaryOwners, setPrimaryOwners] = useState([]);
const [secondaryOwners, setSecondaryOwners] = useState([]);
const [activeTab, setActiveTab] = useState('primary');
```

#### Data Fetching:
```javascript
// Fetches both types separately
const [primaryData, secondaryData] = await Promise.all([
  spaService.getPrimaryOwners(),
  spaService.getSecondaryOwners(),
]);
```

#### Form Data:
```javascript
// Before:
{ fullname: '', parent_owner: '' }

// After:
{ fullname: '', email: '', phone: '' }
```

#### CRUD Operations:
- ✅ Create/Update/Delete based on `activeTab`
- ✅ Separate API calls for primary and secondary owners
- ✅ Context-aware success messages

#### New Tabs UI:
```jsx
<div className="flex border-b border-gray-200">
  <button onClick={() => setActiveTab('primary')}>
    <Crown /> Primary Owners ({primaryOwners.length})
  </button>
  <button onClick={() => setActiveTab('secondary')}>
    <UserCheck /> Secondary Owners ({secondaryOwners.length})
  </button>
</div>
```

## 📊 Data Flow

### Creating an Owner:

```
1. User clicks "Add Primary Owner" button
2. Modal opens with form fields:
   - Full Name (required)
   - Email (optional)
   - Phone (optional)
3. User fills form and submits
4. Based on activeTab:
   - If 'primary' → POST /api/primary-owners/
   - If 'secondary' → POST /api/secondary-owners/
5. Success message displays
6. List refreshes with new owner
```

### Switching Tabs:

```
1. User clicks "Secondary Owners" tab
2. activeTab changes to 'secondary'
3. Table shows secondaryOwners data
4. Search filters secondaryOwners
5. "Add" button changes to "Add Secondary Owner"
6. All operations now work with secondary owners
```

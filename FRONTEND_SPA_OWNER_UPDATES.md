# Frontend Spa Owner Updates - Complete

## Summary

Successfully updated all frontend components to work with the new independent Primary and Secondary Owner models with One-to-Many relationships.

## Files Updated

### 1. **Service Layer** - `frontend/Dashboard/admindashbboard/src/services/spaService.js`

#### Changes:
- ✅ Replaced `getSpaOwners()` → `getPrimaryOwners()` and `getSecondaryOwners()`
- ✅ Added separate CRUD operations for Primary Owners:
  - `getPrimaryOwners()`
  - `getPrimaryOwnerById(id)`
  - `createPrimaryOwner(ownerData)`
  - `updatePrimaryOwner(id, ownerData)`
  - `deletePrimaryOwner(id)`
- ✅ Added separate CRUD operations for Secondary Owners:
  - `getSecondaryOwners()`
  - `getSecondaryOwnerById(id)`
  - `createSecondaryOwner(ownerData)`
  - `updateSecondaryOwner(id, ownerData)`
  - `deleteSecondaryOwner(id)`

#### New API Endpoints:
```javascript
/api/primary-owners/       // Primary owners CRUD
/api/secondary-owners/     // Secondary owners CRUD
/api/spas/                 // Spas CRUD (unchanged)
```

  owner.fullname.toLowerCase().includes(secondaryOwnerSearch.toLowerCase())
);
```

#### Logic Added:
```javascript
// Combine primary and secondary owners for filter dropdown
const allOwners = [
  ...primaryOwners.map(o => ({ ...o, type: 'Primary' })),
  ...secondaryOwners.map(o => ({ ...o, type: 'Secondary' }))
].sort((a, b) => a.fullname.localeCompare(b.fullname));
```

#### Owner Filter Dropdown:
```javascript
// Now shows owner type
{allOwners.map((owner) => (
  <option key={`${owner.type}-${owner.id}`} value={owner.id}>
    {owner.fullname} ({owner.type})
  </option>
))}
```

#### Status Filter Updated:
